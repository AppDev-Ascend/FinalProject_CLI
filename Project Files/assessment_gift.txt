::Multiple Choice::

::1 What is the purpose of the Prototype pattern?::
~To create new objects from scratch =To copy an existing object as a blueprint for creating new objects ~To reduce the complexity of object creation ~To maintain object relationships 

::2 Which component is responsible for creating new objects using the Prototype pattern?::
~Prototype ~Concrete Prototype =Client ~Prototype Registry 

::3 When is the Prototype pattern useful?::
~When object creation is more efficient by copying an existing object ~When a class cannot anticipate the type of objects it must create ~When configuring complex objects with different properties =All of the above 

::4 What are the pros of using the Prototype pattern?::
~Object creation efficiency and flexible object creation ~Reduced complexity and maintains object relationships ~Efficient cloning and reduced need for proper initialization =All of the above 

::5 What are the cons of using the Prototype pattern?::
=Cloning complexity and potential for inefficient cloning ~Need for proper initialization and maintaining prototypes ~Object creation efficiency and reduced complexity ~All of the above
