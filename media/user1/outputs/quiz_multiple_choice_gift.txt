::Question::What is the purpose of implementing the Cloneable interface in Java??
= To indicate that an object can be safely cloned using the clone() method
~ To provide a way to create a deep copy of an object
~ To override the clone() method in the Object class
~ To prevent the JVM from throwing a CloneNotSupportedException
::Question::What happens if an object does not implement the Cloneable interface in Java??
~ The object cannot be cloned using the clone() method
~ The object will be automatically deep copied
= The JVM will throw a CloneNotSupportedException
~ The object will be shallow copied
::Question::What is the result of attempting to clone an object without implementing the Cloneable interface and the clone() method??
~ The object will be deep copied
= The JVM will throw a CloneNotSupportedException
~ The object will be shallow copied
~ The object cannot be cloned
::Question::What is the purpose of the clone() method in Java??
= To create a deep copy of an object
~ To indicate that an object can be safely cloned using the clone() method
~ To override the clone() method in the Object class
~ To prevent the JVM from throwing a CloneNotSupportedException
::Question::Which approach closely mimics the Cloneable feature and is Java-specific??
= Using the Cloneable interface
~ Implementing a custom clone method
~ Using the Serializable interface
~ Using the Comparable interface
