::Question::What is the Prototype Design Pattern??
= The Prototype Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that allows objects to be created by cloning an existing object.
::Question::How is the Prototype Design Pattern used in software development??
= It is used to create new objects by copying existing objects, reducing the need for complex object creation logic.
::Question::What are the benefits of using the Prototype Design Pattern??
= It simplifies object creation, improves performance, and allows for dynamic object creation.
::Question::What are the drawbacks of using the Prototype Design Pattern??
= It can increase memory usage and may require implementing a deep copy mechanism.
::Question::When is the Prototype Design Pattern useful??
= It is useful when creating objects is expensive or complex, and when objects need to be created dynamically at runtime.
::Question::What is the role of the Prototype in the Prototype Design Pattern??
= The Prototype serves as the base object that is cloned to create new objects.
::Question::What is the role of the Concrete Prototype in the Prototype Design Pattern??
= The Concrete Prototype is a specific implementation of the Prototype that is cloned to create new objects.
::Question::What is the role of the Client in the Prototype Design Pattern??
= The Client is responsible for creating new objects by cloning the Prototype.
::Question::What is the Subclass Prototype used for in the Prototype Design Pattern??
= The Subclass Prototype is used to create objects that inherit from the Prototype and provide specialized behavior.

::Section::Test 4::Fill in the Blanks::
::Question::What is the Prototype Design Pattern? is ___?
= The Prototype Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that allows us to make new objects by copying existing objects, known as prototype.
::Question::How is the Prototype Design Pattern used in software development? is ___?
= The Prototype Design Pattern is used in software development to improve performance and reduce resource usage by reusing objects for creating new ones.
::Question::What are the benefits of using the Prototype Design Pattern? is ___?
= The benefits of using the Prototype Design Pattern include efficient object creation, reducing subclassing, and configuring objects with different properties.
::Question::What are the drawbacks of using the Prototype Design Pattern? is ___?
= There are no drawbacks mentioned for using the Prototype Design Pattern.
::Question::When is the Prototype Design Pattern useful? is ___?
= The Prototype Design Pattern is useful in situations where object creation is resource-intensive or complex.
::Question::What is the role of the Prototype in the Prototype Design Pattern? is ___?
= The Prototype is the interface or abstract class that declares the methods for cloning itself.
::Question::What is the role of the Concrete Prototype in the Prototype Design Pattern? is ___?
= The Concrete Prototype is the concrete class that implements the Prototype interface or extends the Prototype abstract class.
::Question::What is the role of the Client in the Prototype Design Pattern? is ___?
= The Client is responsible for creating new objects by requesting the prototype to clone itself.
::Question::What is the Subclass Prototype used for in the Prototype Design Pattern? is ___?
= The Subclass Prototype is used to highlight that if the concrete prototype is extended, it is preferable to override the clone method.
::Question::How does the Prototype Design Pattern work? is ___?
= The Prototype Design Pattern works by creating new objects by copying existing objects, known as prototypes, using the clone method provided by the prototype.
