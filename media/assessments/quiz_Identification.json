{"type": "Identification", "questions": [{"question": "What is the Prototype Design Pattern?", "answer": "The Prototype Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that allows objects to be created by cloning an existing object."}, {"question": "How is the Prototype Design Pattern used in software development?", "answer": "It is used to create new objects by copying existing objects, reducing the need for complex object creation logic."}, {"question": "What are the benefits of using the Prototype Design Pattern?", "answer": "It simplifies object creation, improves performance, and allows for dynamic object creation."}, {"question": "What are the drawbacks of using the Prototype Design Pattern?", "answer": "It can increase memory usage and may require implementing a deep copy mechanism."}, {"question": "When is the Prototype Design Pattern useful?", "answer": "It is useful when creating objects is expensive or complex, and when objects need to be created dynamically at runtime."}, {"question": "What is the role of the Prototype in the Prototype Design Pattern?", "answer": "The Prototype serves as the base object that is cloned to create new objects."}, {"question": "What is the role of the Concrete Prototype in the Prototype Design Pattern?", "answer": "The Concrete Prototype is a specific implementation of the Prototype that is cloned to create new objects."}, {"question": "What is the role of the Client in the Prototype Design Pattern?", "answer": "The Client is responsible for creating new objects by cloning the Prototype."}, {"question": "What is the Subclass Prototype used for in the Prototype Design Pattern?", "answer": "The Subclass Prototype is used to create objects that inherit from the Prototype and provide specialized behavior."}]}
