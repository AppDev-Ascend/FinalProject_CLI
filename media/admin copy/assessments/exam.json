{"type": "Exam", "sections": [{"name": "Test 1", "type": "Multiple Choice", "questions": [{"question": "What is a recommended practice when dealing with a large number of prototype objects in the Prototype Design Pattern?", "options": ["Ignore the number of prototype objects", "Use a Prototype Registry", "Avoid using prototype objects", "Delete some prototype objects"], "answer": 1}]}, {"name": "Test 2", "type": "True or False", "questions": [{"question": "The Prototype Design Pattern is used to create new instances by copying an existing 'prototype' or template, thus saving time and resources.", "answer": "True"}, {"question": "The Prototype Design Pattern is not useful when creating similar characters with different attributes in game development.", "answer": "False"}]}, {"name": "Test 3", "type": "Essay", "questions": [{"question": "How does the Prototype Design Pattern contribute to resource efficiency in software development?"}, {"question": "What considerations should be made when deciding to use shallow or deep cloning in the Prototype Design Pattern?"}, {"question": "What is the role of a Prototype Registry in the Prototype Design Pattern and when should it be considered?"}]}, {"name": "Test 4", "type": "Fill in the Blanks", "questions": [{"question": "The Prototype Design Pattern is similar to using a _______ to create new objects.", "answer": "template"}, {"question": "In the Prototype Design Pattern, the original object that is copied is known as the _______.", "answer": "prototype"}, {"question": "The Prototype Design Pattern can be used to clone _______ records when creating new records with similar attributes.", "answer": "database"}, {"question": "When dealing with a large number of prototype objects or when resource efficiency is a concern, it is advisable to use a _______.", "answer": "Prototype Registry"}]}, {"name": "Test 5", "type": "Identification", "questions": [{"question": "What is the purpose of using the Prototype Design Pattern in graphical user interfaces?", "answer": "The Prototype Design Pattern is used in graphical user interfaces to create copies of GUI components such as buttons and dialogs. This helps save time and resources when generating similar UI elements."}, {"question": "How does the Prototype Design Pattern assist in database operations?", "answer": "The Prototype Design Pattern can be used to clone database records, especially when creating new records with similar attributes."}, {"question": "What is the role of a Prototype Registry in the Prototype Design Pattern?", "answer": "A Prototype Registry is considered when dealing with a large number of prototype objects or when resource efficiency is a concern. Prototype objects are registered with the registry during application initialization for easy access."}, {"question": "What is the importance of documenting Prototype Objects in the Prototype Design Pattern?", "answer": "Documenting Prototype Objects is important as it defines and describes the prototype objects that serve as templates for creating new objects. It ensures that prototype objects are clear, complete, and well-documented, describing their properties, behaviors, and intended use."}, {"question": "How does the Prototype Design Pattern save time and resources?", "answer": "The Prototype Design Pattern saves time and resources by copying an existing prototype to create new objects, instead of creating them from scratch. This is especially useful when making something difficult or something that takes a lot of effort."}]}]}
