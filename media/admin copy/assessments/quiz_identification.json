{"type": "Identification", "questions": [{"question": "What is the purpose of using the Prototype Design Pattern in graphical user interfaces?", "answer": "The Prototype Design Pattern is used in graphical user interfaces to create copies of GUI components such as buttons and dialogs. This helps save time and resources when generating similar UI elements."}, {"question": "How does the Prototype Design Pattern assist in database operations?", "answer": "The Prototype Design Pattern can be used to clone database records, especially when creating new records with similar attributes."}, {"question": "What is the role of a Prototype Registry in the Prototype Design Pattern?", "answer": "A Prototype Registry is considered when dealing with a large number of prototype objects or when resource efficiency is a concern. Prototype objects are registered with the registry during application initialization for easy access."}, {"question": "What is the importance of documenting Prototype Objects in the Prototype Design Pattern?", "answer": "Documenting Prototype Objects is important as it defines and describes the prototype objects that serve as templates for creating new objects. It ensures that prototype objects are clear, complete, and well-documented, describing their properties, behaviors, and intended use."}, {"question": "How does the Prototype Design Pattern save time and resources?", "answer": "The Prototype Design Pattern saves time and resources by copying an existing prototype to create new objects, instead of creating them from scratch. This is especially useful when making something difficult or something that takes a lot of effort."}]}
