Prototype Pattern Summary

History

The first example of the Prototype pattern was in Ivan Sutherland's Sketchpad System in
1964. In 1994, The Gang of Four popularized and codified the Prototype Pattern in their
book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software."

Definition

A prototype pattern is a creational design pattern that focuses on creating objects by
copying an existing object, known as the "prototype," rather than creating new instances
from scratch. In this pattern, a prototype object serves as a blueprint, and new objects are
created by duplicating this prototype.

Key Components

Prototype: The interface or abstract class that declares the methods for cloning itself.
Concrete Prototype: The concrete classes that implement the Prototype interface or
extend the Prototype abstract class.

Client: Responsible for creating new objects by requesting the prototype to clone itself.

Usages

Efficient Object Creation: When object creation is more efficient by copying an existing
object rather than initializing a new one from scratch.

Reducing Subclassing: When a class cannot anticipate the type of objects it must create,
the Prototype Pattern allows for new object creation without relying on subclasses.
Configuring Objects: Allows for configuring complex objects with different properties.

Pros Cons

Object Creation Efficiency Cloning Complexity

Flexible Object Creation Need for Proper Initialization
Reduced Complexity Maintaining Prototypes
Maintains Object Relationships Potential for Inefficient Cloning

Two ways to implement Prototype Pattern in Java
Using the Cloneable Interface and Creating a Custom Clone Method

Cloning Strategies
Shallow Copy and Deep Copy

Prototype Registry: The Prototype Registry is a central repository or store that holds a
collection of pre-defined prototype objects.

Real World Examples
1. Creating similar video game characters with different attributes.
2. Creating copies of GUI components (e.g., buttons, dialogs) to save time and
resources when generating similar Ul elements.
3. Cloning database records
