# FinalProject-CLI
A Command Line Interface (CLI) version of the assessment generator to make the interaction easier with the ChatGPT API during the testing of prompts.

# Setup 
1. Setup your ChatGPT API Key
   - Open the command prompt on your directory folder, then enter this command:
    setx OPENAI_API_KEY "your-api-key-here".

   This will make an environmental variable named OPENAI_API_KEY.
   Please contact me when you need our API Key.

   (Note: Please do not put the API Key anywhere on the code repository.)
2. Install the OpenAI module:
   - pip install openai
